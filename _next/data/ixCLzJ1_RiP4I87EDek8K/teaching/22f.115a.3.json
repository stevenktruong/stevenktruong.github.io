I recommend using <a href=\"https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials\">Overleaf</a> if you've never typed up math before.</p>\n<p>Homework should be turned in through Gradescope, and it will be graded by a reader. This means that <strong>none of the TA's are grading your homework</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"office-hours\">Office Hours</h3>\n<p>If you're unable to attend my office hours, then feel free to send me an e-mail and we can set up an appointment to meet at a different time.
