I recommend using <a href=\"https://www.overleaf.com/\">Overleaf</a> if you've never typed up math before. <strong>This is not a requirement</strong>, so you can still write up your homework however you like (e.g., with a tablet, scanning a separate sheet of paper, etc.).</p>\n<p>Homework should be turned in through Gradescope and is <strong>due by 5pm each Friday</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"office-hours\">Office Hours</h3>\n<p>If you're unable to attend my office hours, then feel free to send me an e-mail and we can set up an appointment to meet at a different time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"e-mails\">E-mails</h3>\n<p>I'm usually quick to respond to e-mails, so if you don't get a reply by the end of the day, feel free to send another one.
