I recommend using <a href=\"https://www.overleaf.com/\">Overleaf</a> if you've never typed up math before. <strong>This is not a requirement</strong>, so you can still write up your homework however you like (e.g., with a tablet, scanning a separate sheet of paper, etc.) as long as I can read it.</p>\n<!-- -   Two problems chosen by the TA will be graded for correctness, and the remaining problems will be graded by completion.\n\n-   What is considered \"complete\" is at the grader's discretion, but as a rule of thumb, if you wrote down what you think is a correct solution, then you will get full completion points for that problem. -->\n<h3 id=\"office-hours\">Office Hours</h3>\n<p>If you're unable to attend my office hours, then feel free to send me an e-mail and we can set up an appointment to meet at a different time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"e-mails\">E-mails</h3>\n<p>I'm usually quick to respond to e-mails, so if you don't get a reply by the end of the day, feel free to send another one.
